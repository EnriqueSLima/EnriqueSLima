-  Hi, I’m @EnriqueSLima
-  I’m very curious person, who wants to colaborate and learning about coding and security systems.
-  I’m currently (re)learning C, C++, Python and some frameworks with JavaScript.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on projects to make difference in the world.
-  Knowlegde is the most valuable thing to have and to share.

From Jinjer - Perrenial - "From the ashes of my roots, a new me will rise and live again".

For the people who suffers with war, I wish an urgent end for that nightmare.
